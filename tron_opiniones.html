      <p>Great great movie always get chills from the music and when he first uses the bike. Love the atmosphere of Sam Flynn's life and how much love he has for his father at the end of the movie. Fantastic message in the movie where we as people think things are important in our life such as work or possessions but nothing is more important then family üëç.</p>

      <p>It's not highly likely to win many new converts, but for those who already like the original and want to see more of that world, it more than satisfies. The visuals are a wonderful evolution from Tron and the story of a father and son who have to make up for lost time is very touching. The CGI face they developed for Jeff Bridges is not perfect, but it works very well with just a few exceptions and I feel, for my own tastes, that they have actually bridged the uncanny valley with this one. Still a bit of work to get it perfect, but this one works as it is. Oh, and the score by Daft Punk is beautiful. The first thing my brother and I did after leaving the theater was buy the sound track on the way home. It's very suggestive of the original but with plenty of today's newer sensibilities mixed in.</p>

      <p>What are the reasons why see "Tron: Legacy"? You must be a fan of the first movie, The visuals looks stunning, hot chicks, and Daft Punk. Unfortunately you might get disappointed cause of the weak plot and slowness of the pacing. But if don't care about the story then you'll enjoy the visuals and the music score of Daft Punk. "Tron Legacy" is still worth watching if you want to see some awesome visuals and love Daft Punk.</p>

      <p>The sequel to Tron took the right approach to the marketing and went into effect a good year before the film came out. Recognising that many people (apart from real fans) will only have a hazy recollection of the film and will probably vaguely remember it as "good" but really only remember the iconic bikers and design of it all, the marketing focused on the updated design, bikes etc that make up this world. In every interview there was always a smattering of talk about father/son and comments made on the power and omnipresent nature of computers and networks but really it was the visual aspects of the film that were pushed to the front. So it was with the marketing, so it is with the film where we join the rebellious son of Flynn as he gets sucked into the grid and discovers that his father's dream has been corrupted by a clone programme of himself.</p>

      <p>Powerful sounds & special effects, a dystopian computer world and a classic human vs. machine battle for survival. What's not to like!? Well, unfortunately enough that it's not an instant classic, but still a terrific addition to sci-fi cinema! What is so cool about the movie is the upgraded but still retro feeling of the Tron world. The detail is striking and pulls us in and keeps us in a strange land. It is a rather bleak world (why didn't they program in some sunlight?)... so we're thankful for the welcome bits of levity and "human-ness" found in the father-son connections. Quorra also provides smiles and such wonderful soulful eyes we can almost sense things will be okay from her gaze alone.

        <p>Sadly, TRON is just another casualty of eye candy. Whether it is the sublime virtual world which rehashes 28 year old ideas infused with modern pixel engines, or the pretty and naive Ms. Wilde tucked in her tights and serving as the Megan Fox of Tronville- TRON does not fly. It grudgingly crawls through a plot that is as expected and transparent as government propaganda: there's good, there's bad, there's conflict, and there's the evident triumph of good over evil. In the way, we meet characters which serve no point, have neither depth nor lifespan, and have nothing but to provide except for additional FX opportunities.</p>
